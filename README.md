# Personality Test Application (Access to Full Repository Available Upon Request)

## Description
This C++ application conducts a personality test by asking users a series of questions and then matches them with fictional characters based on their responses. Utilizing linear algebra and data structures such as sets and maps, the program allows users to select from various fictional universes and find out which character they resemble the most. The results include both unnormalized and normalized scores across five different personality traits: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism.

## Features
- **Interactive Quiz:** Respond to prompts to gauge your personality traits.
- **Multiple Universes:** Choose from various fictional settings to see which character you align with in each.
- **Score Analysis:** View detailed unnormalized and normalized scores to understand the match.
- **Creative Component:** A special mode that shows a comparative table of all similar characters across chosen universes.

## How to Use
1. **Compile the Code:** Use the provided Makefile to compile the application by running `make` in the terminal.
2. **Run the Application:** Start the program with `./main`.
3. **Follow On-Screen Instructions:** Answer the questions and choose a universe when prompted.
4. **View Results:** After selecting a universe, your character match along with the score breakdown will be displayed.
